    <p>We help provide an all-you-need-to-know basis on the sport of swimming and how to excel as a competitive swimmer, such as how to do each stroke, each turn, the equipment necessary, and more! For our beginners we give a brief introduction about the stroke and the best swimmers in that stroke, as well as the distances for each stroke.
    </p>

    <p>For more experienced swimmers, we have a section that will focus more on technique and how to pace yourself well based on the event you are swimming!
    </p>

    <h2 id = "Freestyle">Freestyle</h2>
    <img id = "header-img" src="images/freestyle.jpg"/>
    <h4> Some of the best freestyle swimmers include Pan Zhanle, Caeleb Dressel, Bobby Finke, and Lukas Martens. </h4>
    <h5> How to Swim Freestyle:</h5>
    <iframe width="300" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xc0FNCna_fw?si=6lEPwzWCFXMQ1bkn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>        <p> First we need to work on our head position. When we're swimming, we need to make sure our head is looking straight down. If not, it will make us swim slower!</p>
        <p> For our breathing position, instead of breathing with our head up, we should turn our head to the side and breathe!</p>
        <p> For our pull, we should enter our fingertips first before putting the rest of our hands in.</p>
        <p> When we pull our arm, we initiate an "Early Vertical Forearm" where we bend our elbow and keep it nice and high.</p>
        <p> When kicking, we have to make sure our legs aren't too far off when we are kicking.</p>
        <p> And finally, when we're swimming, we have to make sure we rotate our body from side to side to increase our distance per stroke.</p>
        <p> Freestyle is one of the most popular strokes in swimming and is the easiest to learn. By using equipment such as pool buoys, fins, kickboards, and paddles, swimmers will be able to swim faster freestyle, while also utilizing the next best thing: underwaters.</p>
   
    <h2 id = "Backstroke">Backstroke</h2>
    <img id = "header-img" src="images/backstroke.jpg"/>
    <h4> Some of the best backstroke swimmers include Ryan Murphy, Regan Smith, Ryan Lochte, and Kaylee McKeown. </h4>
    <h5> How to Swim Backstroke:</h5>
    <iframe width="300" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YkjOvxHsY1g?si=o1lUevdjct99S9L-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> For our body position, we have to keep our hips and head aligned with one another. Dropping our hips will make us sink and decrease our speed.</p>
        <p> When we pull, we have our thumb exit the water first. In a windmill motion, our arm enters the water again with our pinky entering the water.</p>
        <p> Our kick is similar to freestyle kicking, fluttering and kicking as fast as we can with a small distance between our legs.</p>
        <p> When we rotate our body, we have to rotate both our hips and our shoulders to swim faster.</p>
        <p> Finally, we have to remember to use our underwaters as best as we can when we push off the wall.</p>
        <p> Backstroke is considered an "easy" stroke to swim for cooldown. Like freestyle, we can use equipment to help us get faster in backstroke. Equipment like pool buoys and fins will help you with your kick, as well as kicking streamline on your back.</p>


    <h2 id = "Breaststroke">Breaststroke</h2>
    <img id = "header-img" src="images/breastroke.jpg"/>
    <h4> Some of the best breaststroke swimmers include Adam Peaty, Qin Haiyang, Tatjana Smith, and Kate Douglass. </h4>
    <h5> How to Swim Breaststroke:</h5>
    <iframe width="300" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-V6TwcSs1nk?si=cyFyyI3kMahATm6u" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> First we need to enter a streamline body position. Keeping our hips high and our head down allows us to increase our speed as we swim.</p>
        <p> Breaststroke comes with 3 steps: the Pull, the Kick, and the Glide.</p>
        <p> The pull starts with your hands in a streamline position. Next we sweep our hands around and move them close to our chest while keeping our elbows high in that early vertical forearm. As the hands move towards our chest, we lift our head up and take a breath. When pushing forward, we put our head back down in streamline position while only pushing them forward explosively.</p>
        <p> When breathing, lift our head up as much as you can without your hips sinking. </p>
        <p> The kick is a 4-step motion: up, out, around, and together. It is similar to a frog kick in which you put your heels up to your butt, kicking outward with both legs, and snapping them together back in place.</p>
        <p> Last thing to go over is the underwater pullout, which can be used heavily in races. Push off in a streamline position off the wall, perform one dolphin kick, then bring your arms by your side and complete a breaststroke kick before returning to streamline.</p>
        <p> Breaststroke is considered one of the easier strokes to swim slowly, but swimming fast may require a lot more work. It doesn't really make use of a lot of equipment; however, kickboards and parachutes can be used to help your kick and increase your speed.</p>

    <h2 id = "Butterfly">Butterfly</h2>
    <img id = "header-img" src="images/butterfly.jpg"/>
    <h4> Some of the best butterfly swimmers include Michael Phelps, Gretchen Walsh, Summer Mcintosh, and Leon Marchand. </h4>
    <h5> How to Swim Butterfly:</h5>
    <iframe width="300" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EU7Hyo_oy2k?si=v5nlqQQpKShRRoPY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> Like all other strokes, butterfly requires good body position. By putting your hips high and your head in a neutral position, you will be able to swim faster butterfly.</p>
        <p> The butterfly pull is also pretty easy. Your hands will move together at the same time, entering the water flat and in line with your shoulders. By initiating the early vertical forearm as you put your arms back and around, it maximizes the amount of water that you can pull.</p>
        <p> For the out-of-water recovery, you should sweep your arms out wide and return to the starting position. Relaxing them is the key to maximize pull.</p>
        <p> Butterfly kick is also pretty important. It is similar to a dolphin kick in which you kick using both of your legs. One key aspect to focus on when kicking is to use your HIPS, not your knees, and kick up and down as you move through the water.</p>
        <p> Finally, when you breathe in butterfly, you should lift your head up a bit slightly before putting your face back in the water. Don't put your head up too high or else your hips will sink and will increase your drag through the water.</p>
        <p> For the out-of-water recovery, you should sweep your arms out wide and return to the starting position. Relaxing them is the key to maximize pull.</p>
        <p> Butterfly, while it may be easy to learn, is the hardest of the four strokes to master. This is because it requires a lot of strength to pull through, especially for longer distances. By focusing on equipment like kickboards, parachutes, and fins, as well as doing strength training, a swimmer will be able to excel in butterfly.</p>

    <h2 id = "Individual Medley">Individual Medley</h2>
    <img id = "header-img" src="images/IM.jpg"/>
    <h4> Some of the best IM (individual medley) swimmers include Michael Phelps, Carson Foster, Kate Douglass, and Katie Grimes. </h4>
    <h5> What is the IM?</h5>
    <iframe width="300" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yhd_5T87-rM?si=MZpXfB0LFGeIbMjg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>        
        <p> Now that you have learned all four strokes, you can put them together in an event known as the IM, or individual medley.</p>
        <p> The IM follows this order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle for individual events, and backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle for relays.</p>
        <p> IM in competition is in the form of two formats: individual races and relays of four people. Individual races include the 100 IM (short course only, 25 of each stroke), 200 IM (50 of each stroke), and 400IM (100 of each stroke). Relays consist of either a 200 Medley Relay (50 stroke per person) or a 400 Medley Relay (100 stroke per person) with each person utilizing their main stroke.</p>
        <p> While IM may seem insignificant, it will help engage your muscles in the water and will help burn more calories. By implementing more IM, it will also improve your technique of other strokes that you may have problems in.</p>
        <p> Some sets of training include 4 x 50s IM order, FRIM (replacing butterfly with freestyle), Transition IM (25 fly/25 back, 25 back/25 breast, 25 breast/25 free) and IM/Free (25 fly/25 free, 25 back/25 free, 25 breast/25 free, and 50 free). More sets can be seen down below.</p>
    <h2 id = "More Swimming Qualities You Need">More Swimming Qualities You Need</h2>
    <h4> Without utilizing these swimming qualities, you will not be able to swim fast. </h4>
        <p> Streamline is considered the most important quality in swimming when it comes to body position. Without a proper streamline, it can result in unnecessary drag throughout the water. </p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/streamline.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Underwaters are also really important in swimming, which allow you to kick underwater before reaching to the surface. This allows the swimmer to swim faster in their race if they utilize these underwaters.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/underwaters.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Dryland training is also really important. Just coming to practice is not enough if you want to swim faster. By doing land exercises like push ups and squats or going in the gym, your strength will increase and it will lead you to swim faster in the water.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/dryland.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Nutrition is also really important in swimming. By eating healthy and according to schedule, it allows peak performance.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/nutrition.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Maintaining a positive mindset and environment is the most important in swimming. By focusing on your strengths and weaknesses, as well as maintaining a positive and helpful attitude in and out the pool, it will give you confidence to do better in practice and your races. </p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/positivemindset.jpg" class = "resize-image">

    <h2 id = "Turns">Turns</h2>
    <h4> Fast utilizied turns will allow swimmers to become faster in their races. </h4>
        <p> There are two differenty types of turns in swimming: flip turns and open turns.</p>
        <p> The flip turn is used for freestyle and backstroke. It consists of a swimmer swimming fast into the wall, doing a front flip, and pushing off streamline off the wall. Step-by-step instructions for how to do a flip turn are shown in the video below.</p>
        <iframe width="300" height="170" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlwY4TnU6rY?si=8Zl1vbL0FwKqtEGy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> An open turn is a little bit easier than a flip turn, and is typically used for breaststroke and butterfly. It involves the swimmer swimming into the wall, touching the wall with two hands, bringing your knees to your chest, dropping one elbow/arm to the chest (Elbow Brother), bending top arm to connect to other arm (Call Mother), and push off streamline. More information can be shown below:</p>

    <h2 id = "Equipment">Equipment</h2>
    <h4> Equipment like a swimsuit, cap, and goggles are required for competitive swimming. Others are optional; however, utilizing these tools will help you become a faster swimmer. </h4>
        <p> Kickboards are the most common piece of equipment for swimmers, and can be used for any stroke. You use this by putting your hands on the top of the board while keeping your arms straight and kicking This allows you to work on your stroke kick and improve it by doing kick sets.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/kickboard.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> A pull buoy helps you work on your pull in the water. You use this by putting the buoy tightly between your legs and pulling yourself through the water without kicking. This is really good for distance swimmers who are swimming more than 200 meters/yards.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/pullbuoy.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Paddles help you pull more water, and can be used with other equipment like pool buoys and snorkels. Mishandling of this tool, however, could result in injury due to imperfect technique, so it is important to be careful.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/paddles.png" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Fins are also another common piece of equipment that allows you to swim faster! It also allows you to develop more flexibility in your ankles and allow you to better your kick, and can be used with equipment like paddles and kickboards.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/fins.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> A snorkel could also be used as equipment and can help balance your technique and head/body position, as well as help with your breathing.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/snorkel.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> An ankle band can be considered one of the hardest equipment to use, as it makes your legs sink, focusing more on your arms and your hips to be high up. However, if you have swimmer's shoulder, it shouldn't be used as much. It can also be used for "resistance" training while also balancing your stroke rate.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/ankleband.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> A parachute is another resistance equipment that creates extra drag when you swim in the water. This allows you to put your all in your arms and legs to increase your swim strength.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/parachute.jpg" class = "resize-image">

    <h2 id = "Types">Types</h2>
    <h4> There are two different types of swimmers: sprint swimmers and distance swimmers. </h4>
        <p> Sprint swimmers include distances such as the 50 or the 100. This consists of you to go ALL-OUT in both your strokes and your turns. This means that if you miss one turn or fall too short, you might go much slower than other sprint swimmers, which could be by a second or more. Famous sprinters include Florent Manaudou and Caeleb Dressel.</p>
        <img id = "flex-img" src = "images/florentmammadou.jpg" class = "resize-image">
        <p> Distance swimmers are another category of swimmers, and they include distances such as the 200, 500, 1000, or the 1650. These swimmers focus more on their tempo and maintain a constant speed until the final 100 or 50 yards/meters to go all out. Famous distance swimmers include Katie Ledecky and Bobby Finke.</p>
